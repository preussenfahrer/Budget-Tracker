# Description
Budget-Tracker (_BT_) is a simple to use way to keep up with your finances. When you keep track of your finances and can see where your money is going, you are more confident in knowing not only where your money goes, but where it needs to be. However, what happens if you're using the application and the internet connection is bad, or non existent? No need to fear, _BT_ will store your data and you can still use it offline! This is because _BT_ is a PWA, an app that can be used on any device, from any location, in any circumstance.
